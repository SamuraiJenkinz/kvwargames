## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Roadmap: TypeScript interfaces before everything else — cascade rework cost of changing `GameState` post-Phase 1 is high; the lock-in is intentional
- Roadmap: Backend built Phase 2, before UI (Phases 3–5) — backend tests independently with curl; no stub-then-real round trip
- Roadmap: UI layout against mock data (Phase 5) before LLM wiring (Phase 6) — decouples visual development from LLM iteration
- Roadmap: Config generation deferred to Phase 7 — its prompt-engineering risk is independent of the core game loop
- Roadmap: SETUP-04/05 (generate-from-brief wiring) moved to Phase 7, not Phase 4 — setup screen ships with stubbed brief panel

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Phase 6 research flag: Corporate LLM endpoint response structure may deviate from standard OpenAI format — make extraction path configurable in `config.py` before hardcoding; verify against actual endpoint
- Phase 6 research flag: Token budget for system prompt needs measurement before choosing windowed history N — estimated 3,000–4,000 tokens but depends on actual EDIP card count
- Phase 6 research flag: Corporate proxy timeout (est. 30s) vs LLM generation time (25–35s) — verify actual timeout with ops team before Phase 6 completes
- Phase 7 research flag: Config generation prompt needs testing against 3 brief types to establish reliability threshold
